# Name

> Supported in pipeline versions: `version 1`, `version 2`

The `name` field is optional and simply will print out the defined value at the start of the pipeline's execution. An example usage is below:

```yaml
name: An example pipeline name
```

> Note: The name field supports expressions so a variable, an environment variable or a keyword can be used.

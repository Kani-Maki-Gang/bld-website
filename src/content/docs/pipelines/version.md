# Version
The `version` field is a mandatory field that indicates which specific features are available to a pipeline. A new pipeline version is created when a breaking change must be done in the pipeline yaml structure for a specific feature to be supported. Additionally each version has a dedicated runner which means that a new version of bld will execute the existing pipelines as before.

An example of defining a version is below.
```yaml
version: 2
```

Pipeline versions are independent of the bld version, since the pipeline execution or structure might not change at all between releases.

The current available versions and features are listed below.
